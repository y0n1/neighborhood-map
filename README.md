# Neighborhood Map


Neighborhood Map is a web front end project, part of Udacity's nanodegree program. 

# Installation

```javascript
npm install
```

# Usage

There is a NPM task defined which starts a [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).
This task can be executed with the following command:
```javascript
npm run debug
```
The whole code is written in **ES6** so you'll need a modern browser (like Google Chrome v58+) to be able to run the project. Due to CORS there is a script at the root the repository which enables open a Google Chrome window with the --disable-web-security flag, though this script works only in Mac.

# Future milestones and improvements
The following is a list of tasks and improvement it still lacks:

- Create a better documentation
- Add Linux and Windows scripts for running Chrome with --disable-web-security flag
- Improve menu's style
- Add production ready version, possibly using Webpack
