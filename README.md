# Neighborhood Map


Neighborhood Map is a web front end project, part of Udacity's nanodegree program. 

# Installation

```javascript
npm install
```

# Usage

There is a NPM task defined which starts a [http server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).
This task can be executed with the following command:
```javascript
npm start
```
Note: The whole code is written in **ES6** so you'll need a modern browser (like Google Chrome v58+) to be able to run the project.

# Future milestones and improvements
The following is a list of tasks and improvement it still lacks:

- Create a better documentation
- Improve menu's style
- Add production ready version, possibly using Webpack
